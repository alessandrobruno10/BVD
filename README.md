This is an open source software tool provided with a user friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
The software allows to conduct different tasks over Immunohistocheminstry images such as Blood Vessel Detection & Quantification, computation of spatial distribution, area and centroids of vessels. 

Both back and front end functions have been implemented in MATLAB_R2019a. 
Users can download a standalone version of the tool working on Windows and Mac Os. 

The zip file for the installation contains an instruction manual describing how to run all functionalities of BVD.

The code uploaded here is part of the work being published in Annals of Biomedical Engineering.
